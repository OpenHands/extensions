name: PR Review Evaluation (Reusable)

# Reusable workflow for evaluating PR review effectiveness.
# This workflow is called by other repositories to assess how well
# review comments were addressed when a PR is closed.
#
# Security note: This workflow is safe with pull_request_target because:
# 1. Only triggers on PR close (not on code changes)
# 2. Does not checkout PR code - only downloads artifacts from trusted workflow runs
# 3. Runs evaluation scripts from the extensions repo, not from the PR
#
# Usage in other repos:
#   jobs:
#     evaluate:
#       uses: OpenHands/extensions/.github/workflows/pr-review-evaluation-reusable.yml@main
#       secrets:
#         LMNR_SKILLS_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LMNR_SKILLS_API_KEY }}
#         GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
