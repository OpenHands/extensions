# adapt-yourself

This skill is a playbook for “self-modification” requests:

- deciding whether the user actually needs code changes, vs.
- adding a repo/user skill, always-on repo instructions (`AGENTS.md`), hooks (`.openhands/hooks.json`), plugins, or MCP tooling.

The canonical instructions live in [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md).
